# Methodology Foundation

## Purpose
Framework dependency validation ensuring all required testing frameworks are understood before proceeding to systematic analysis phases.

## Entry Requirements
- Step 1 (Context Discovery) outcomes achieved
- Steps 2-3 (Critical Individual Analysis) completed with architectural understanding demonstrated

## Validation Process

### Framework Completeness Review
1. **Strategic Foundations**: Read `../../testing/strategy/risk-based-testing.md` for comprehensive risk-based testing framework
2. **Decision Criteria**: Read `../../testing/meta/decision-framework.md` for risk classification templates and assessment criteria
3. **Mock Boundaries**: Read `../../testing/strategy/mock-boundaries.md` for external vs internal testing decision frameworks
4. **Test Organization**: Read `../../testing/strategy/test-organization.md` for architectural patterns and directory structure guidance

### Methodology Readiness Validation
- **Risk Assessment Framework**: Understand three-tier risk classification (High-risk/Complex/Simple)
- **Boundary Decision Patterns**: Understand external vs internal component testing approaches
- **Test Consolidation Strategy**: Understand "one test, multiple risks" design patterns
- **Implementation Resources**: Understand mock strategies, test organization, and fixture patterns

### Success Criteria
Complete understanding of:
- **Risk-Based Testing Principles**: How to apply three-tier framework to component assessment
- **Boundary Management**: When to test interfaces vs internals
- **Test Design Patterns**: How to map risk classifications to test requirements
- **Implementation Structure**: Available resources and organizational patterns

## Gate Validation
All supporting frameworks must be read and understood before proceeding to boundary and scope analysis. Any gaps in framework understanding require resolution before advancing to Step 5.
