# Phase 1: Complete Core Implementation Context

## Objective
Complete the missing concrete implementation patterns that bridge strategic frameworks to actual test organization. Fill gaps identified in implementation context to create authoritative guidance for test refactoring.

## Scope Constraint
**STRICT**: Only work within the context system. Reference `context-references.md` for all relevant locations. Do not analyze external code or test files.

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Mock Patterns Implementation
**Target**: `../mock-patterns.md` (referenced in `../overview.md:34`)
**Goal**: Translate strategic mock boundary frameworks into concrete implementation decisions

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **External Service Boundaries**: Specific mocking patterns for Forvo, OpenAI, Runware, AnkiConnect
- **File System Boundaries**: Concrete patterns for file operation mocking vs real file usage
- **Environment Boundaries**: Specific environment variable mocking strategies
- **Provider Integration Boundaries**: Where to mock provider interfaces vs full provider behavior

**Strategic Foundation**: Apply patterns from `../strategy/mock-boundaries.md` to component risk classifications in `../component-strategy.md`

### 2. Test Consolidation Implementation
**Target**: `../test-consolidation.md` (referenced in `../overview.md:35`)
**Goal**: Translate "one test, multiple risks" principle into concrete multi-risk test designs

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **E2E Consolidation Patterns**: How single tests validate multiple high-risk components
- **Integration Test Grouping**: Strategic component interaction testing patterns
- **Cross-Component Validation**: Multi-risk scenarios that span component boundaries
- **Risk Overlap Management**: Handling components that span multiple risk categories

**Strategic Foundation**: Apply patterns from `../strategy/test-consolidation.md` to risk classifications in `../component-strategy.md`

### 3. Test Organization Bridge
**Target**: `../test-organization.md` (new file)
**Goal**: Bridge component risk classifications to actual test structure and organization

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **Directory Structure Principles**: How risk levels translate to test organization
- **File Naming Conventions**: Patterns that reflect risk-based testing approach
- **Test Categorization**: Clear boundaries between E2E, Integration, Unit based on risk
- **Component Mapping**: How system components map to test organization

**Strategic Foundation**: Connect component strategy to organizational patterns that support risk-based testing principles

## Success Criteria
Phase 1 succeeds when:
1. **Strategic frameworks** have concrete implementation guidance
2. **Component risk classifications** connect clearly to test patterns
3. **Implementation context** provides authoritative test organization guidance
4. **Bridge exists** between strategy and practical test structure decisions

## Reference Pattern
Use `context-references.md` for all context locations. Explore referenced strategic frameworks thoroughly, then apply systematically to existing component classifications.

## Quality Standards
- **Concrete Specificity**: Move beyond strategic principles to implementable patterns
- **Risk Alignment**: All patterns must align with established risk classifications
- **Framework Consistency**: Maintain consistency with strategic testing frameworks
- **Authoritative Tone**: Write as definitive implementation guidance, not suggestions
