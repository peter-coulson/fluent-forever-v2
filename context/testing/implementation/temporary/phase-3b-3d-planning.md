# Phases 3b-3d: Implementation-Dependent Planning Context

## Purpose
Basic planning context for phases that depend on Phase 3a outcomes. These phases cannot have detailed prompts until 3a blueprint reveals specific logical structure needs.

## Phase 3b: Logical Division Implementation
**Dependencies**: Requires 3a blueprint to determine optimal logical divisions
**Goal**: Translate comprehensive test blueprint into logical organizational structure

**Expected Areas** (contingent on 3a outcomes):
- **Test Category Organization**: How risk levels translate to directory/file structure
- **Component-Based Divisions**: Logical groupings based on component relationships
- **Workflow-Based Divisions**: Test organization around user/system workflows
- **Cross-Cutting Divisions**: Shared testing concerns and utilities

**Planning Context Needed**:
- Logical patterns that emerge from 3a comprehensive component analysis
- Natural organizational boundaries revealed by risk assessment outcomes
- Efficiency patterns for test maintenance and execution

## Phase 3c: Legacy Salvage Analysis
**Dependencies**: Requires 3b logical structure to evaluate salvage candidates
**Goal**: Review existing 62 test files against new blueprint for potential reuse

**Expected Areas** (contingent on 3b outcomes):
- **Salvage Criteria Framework**: Decision matrix for keeping vs discarding tests
- **Component Mapping Analysis**: How existing tests map to new logical structure
- **Code Pattern Extraction**: Reusable test logic vs structural patterns
- **Integration Points**: Where salvaged elements fit into new structure

**Planning Context Needed**:
- Specific logical divisions from 3b to guide salvage evaluation
- Quality criteria for determining salvage-worthy test patterns
- Integration strategy for incorporating salvaged elements

## Phase 3d: Refactor Execution Plan
**Dependencies**: Requires 3c salvage analysis to plan implementation steps
**Goal**: Create step-by-step refactor execution with salvage integration

**Expected Areas** (contingent on 3c outcomes):
- **Implementation Sequence**: Order of test creation/deletion
- **Salvage Integration Strategy**: How to incorporate reusable elements
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Testing the new test suite during refactor
- **Rollback Safety**: Risk mitigation during major structural changes

**Planning Context Needed**:
- Concrete salvage decisions from 3c analysis
- Risk assessment of refactor process itself
- Implementation dependency chains between new test components

## Context Requirements for Future Planning

### From Phase 3a (Test Blueprint)
- **Component Risk Classifications**: Detailed risk assessment outcomes
- **Coverage Requirements**: Specific test coverage patterns per component
- **Consolidation Opportunities**: Multi-risk test scenarios identified
- **Mock Strategy Decisions**: Concrete mocking boundaries per component

### From Phase 3b (Logical Divisions)
- **Organizational Structure**: Directory/file organization patterns
- **Component Groupings**: How components cluster in logical structure
- **Cross-Cutting Patterns**: Shared concerns organization
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Structure optimization decisions

### From Phase 3c (Legacy Analysis)
- **Salvage Inventory**: Specific tests/patterns worth preserving
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluation of existing test quality
- **Integration Mapping**: Where salvaged elements fit
- **Discard Rationale**: Documentation of elimination decisions

## Planning Trigger Criteria

**Phase 3b Planning**: Can begin when 3a provides component risk classifications and coverage patterns
**Phase 3c Planning**: Can begin when 3b provides logical structure framework
**Phase 3d Planning**: Can begin when 3c provides salvage analysis and integration strategy

Each subsequent planning session will create focused prompts based on concrete outcomes from predecessor phases.
