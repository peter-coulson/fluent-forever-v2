# Test Refactoring Planning - Temporary Workspace

## Purpose
Temporary planning documents for complete test suite refactoring using Risk-Based Testing principles. This folder contains scaffolding work that will be **removed** once implementation is complete.

## Refactoring Approach
**Ground-up rebuild** with strategic framework driving all decisions. Legacy tests reviewed only for potential salvage after new design is complete.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Complete Core Implementation Context
**Scope**: Fill missing concrete implementation patterns in permanent context system
**Goal**: Bridge strategy frameworks to actual test organization
**Constraint**: Only reference existing context system - no external code analysis

### Phase 2: Strategic Detail Completion
**Scope**: Complete missing strategic framework components
**Goal**: Ensure decision frameworks and boundaries are fully specified
**Constraint**: Only enhance existing strategic patterns - no new frameworks

### Phase 3a: Comprehensive Test Blueprint
**Scope**: Apply risk framework systematically to all system components
**Goal**: Define complete test coverage from first principles
**Constraint**: Risk-based decisions only - no legacy test influence

### Phases 3b-3d: Implementation Dependent
**Deferred**: Cannot plan until 3a blueprint reveals logical structure needs

## Success Criteria
This temporary workspace succeeds when:
1. **Permanent context system** is complete and authoritative
2. **Test blueprint** provides clear rebuild guidance from risk principles
3. **Agent prompts** enable focused execution of each phase
4. **This folder can be deleted** after implementation completion

## Context Constraint
**STRICT RULE**: All phase work must reference only files within `context/` directory. No external code analysis permitted during planning phases.

## Navigation
- **Context References**: `context-references.md` - DRY consolidation of relevant context locations
- **Phase Prompts**: `phase-[1|2|3a]-prompt.md` - Agent execution guidance for each phase
