# Phase 3a: Comprehensive Test Blueprint

## Objective
Apply risk framework systematically to all system components to define complete test coverage from first principles. Create authoritative test blueprint without any influence from existing tests.

## Scope Constraint
**STRICT**: Only work within the context system. Reference `context-references.md` for all relevant locations. **ABSOLUTELY NO** analysis of existing test files or external code. Pure first-principles design from risk assessment.

## Critical Principle
**Ground-Up Design**: Ignore existing test implementation completely. Design optimal test coverage based solely on risk framework and system component analysis from context system.

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Systematic Component Risk Assessment
**Target**: `complete-risk-assessment.md`
**Goal**: Apply completed risk framework to every system component systematically

**Assessment Areas**:
- **Core Components**: Pipeline, Stage, Context, Config (from core concepts)
- **Provider System**: Registry, MediaProvider, DataProvider, SyncProvider (from provider overview)
- **CLI System**: Commands, Runner, Argument Processing (from CLI overview)
- **Cross-Cutting**: Logging, Configuration, Error Handling (from system overview)

**Risk Classification**: Apply decision framework to assign E2E/Integration/Unit testing levels based on:
- External dependency complexity
- Component interaction patterns
- Failure impact assessment
- System integration criticality

### 2. Test Coverage Blueprint
**Target**: `test-coverage-blueprint.md`
**Goal**: Define exact test coverage requirements for each risk level

**Coverage Specifications**:
- **E2E Test Scenarios**: Complete workflows with real external dependencies
- **Integration Test Patterns**: Component interaction testing with strategic mocking
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Individual component logic validation with full mocking
- **Cross-Component Validation**: Multi-component interaction patterns

**Quality Criteria**: For each component, specify:
- Required test scenarios
- Mock boundary decisions
- Validation assertions
- Success/failure criteria

### 3. Test Consolidation Design
**Target**: `consolidation-design.md`
**Goal**: Apply "one test, multiple risks" principle to create efficient multi-risk test scenarios

**Consolidation Areas**:
- **High-Risk Consolidation**: E2E tests that validate multiple high-risk components simultaneously
- **Medium-Risk Grouping**: Integration tests that efficiently test component interactions
- **Risk Overlap Optimization**: Tests that span multiple risk categories strategically
- **Workflow-Based Testing**: Complete user workflows that validate entire component chains

### 4. Mock Strategy Blueprint
**Target**: `mock-strategy-blueprint.md`
**Goal**: Define comprehensive mocking strategy based on component risk and boundary analysis

**Mock Strategy Areas**:
- **External Service Mocking**: Specific strategies for each external dependency
- **Component Interface Mocking**: Internal component boundary mocking decisions
- **Test Environment Isolation**: Environment and configuration mocking patterns
- **Data Flow Mocking**: Context and state management mocking strategies

## Design Methodology
1. **Component Discovery**: Systematically identify all components from context system
2. **Risk Assessment**: Apply completed risk framework to each component
3. **Coverage Design**: Define optimal test coverage for each risk level
4. **Consolidation Planning**: Identify efficient multi-risk test opportunities
5. **Mock Strategy**: Define strategic mocking boundaries for each component

## Success Criteria
Phase 3a succeeds when:
1. **Every system component** has risk-based test coverage defined
2. **Test blueprint** provides clear guidance for optimal test implementation
3. **First principles design** is complete without legacy test influence
4. **Consolidation strategy** maximizes testing efficiency through multi-risk scenarios

## Reference Pattern
Use `context-references.md` for all context locations. Build systematically on completed strategic frameworks from Phases 1 and 2. Focus on system component understanding from context system only.

## Quality Standards
- **Systematic Completeness**: Every component must be assessed and covered
- **Risk-Based Design**: All decisions driven by risk framework application
- **Strategic Optimization**: Efficient test design through consolidation principles
- **Pure First Principles**: Zero influence from existing test implementation
- **Blueprint Authority**: Definitive guidance for test implementation phases
