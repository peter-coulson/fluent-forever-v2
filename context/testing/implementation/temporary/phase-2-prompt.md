# Phase 2: Strategic Detail Completion

## Objective
Complete missing strategic framework components to ensure decision frameworks and boundaries are fully specified. Enhance existing strategic patterns without introducing new frameworks.

## Scope Constraint
**STRICT**: Only work within the context system. Reference `context-references.md` for all relevant locations. Focus on completing existing strategic patterns, not creating new frameworks.

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Scaffolding Lifecycle Implementation
**Target**: `../strategy/scaffolding-lifecycle.md` (referenced but incomplete)
**Goal**: Complete the scaffolding lifecycle management patterns for development â†’ production transitions

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **Development Phase Patterns**: Testing approaches during initial component development
- **Scaffolding Removal Criteria**: When and how to transition from scaffolding to production tests
- **Production Transition Strategies**: Systematic approaches for moving from development scaffolding
- **Lifecycle Decision Points**: Clear criteria for scaffolding vs production test decisions

**Foundation**: Build on Risk-Based Testing principles and "scaffolding test" approach mentioned in strategic overview

### 2. Decision Framework Completion
**Target**: `../meta/decision-framework.md` (referenced but may need completion)
**Goal**: Ensure risk classification templates and decision criteria are fully specified

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **Risk Classification Criteria**: Detailed templates for assessing component risk levels
- **Mock Boundary Decision Matrix**: Clear criteria for internal vs external testing boundaries
- **Test Strategy Selection**: Decision trees for choosing E2E vs Integration vs Unit approaches
- **Component Assessment Framework**: Systematic approach for evaluating component testing needs

**Foundation**: Align with Risk-Based Testing principles and component strategy patterns

### 3. Content Boundaries Refinement
**Target**: `../meta/boundaries.md` (may need enhancement)
**Goal**: Finalize content inclusion/exclusion rules for testing context

**Key Areas to Address**:
- **Strategic vs Tactical Boundaries**: Clear distinctions for context content appropriateness
- **Implementation Detail Exclusions**: Specific guidance on what implementation details to exclude
- **Context Scope Management**: Rules for maintaining appropriate abstraction levels
- **Cross-Reference Guidelines**: How context documents should reference each other

**Foundation**: Support the context system principles and maintain strategic focus

## Enhancement Strategy
For each deliverable:
1. **Assess Current State**: Examine existing content and identify gaps
2. **Maintain Framework Consistency**: Ensure alignment with established Risk-Based Testing principles
3. **Complete Missing Patterns**: Fill strategic gaps without duplicating existing content
4. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure framework provides sufficient guidance for implementation context

## Success Criteria
Phase 2 succeeds when:
1. **Strategic frameworks** are complete and comprehensive
2. **Decision criteria** provide clear guidance for risk assessment and boundary decisions
3. **Framework gaps** identified in context system are filled
4. **Meta system** provides sufficient guidance for maintaining testing context

## Reference Pattern
Use `context-references.md` for all context locations. Build on existing strategic foundations rather than creating new frameworks. Maintain consistency with established Risk-Based Testing approach.

## Quality Standards
- **Framework Completeness**: Ensure strategic patterns address all identified needs
- **Decision Clarity**: Provide clear, actionable criteria for strategic decisions
- **Principle Alignment**: Maintain consistency with Risk-Based Testing foundations
- **Strategic Focus**: Keep content at appropriate strategic abstraction level
