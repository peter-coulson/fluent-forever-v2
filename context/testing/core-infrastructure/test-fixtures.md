# Infrastructure Test Fixtures Strategy

Strategic patterns for test fixtures supporting infrastructure-only testing without business logic dependencies.

## Fixture Architecture Principles

### Minimal Implementation Strategy

**Infrastructure-Only Focus**:
- Concrete interface implementations with minimal business logic
- Configurable behavior patterns for multiple test scenarios
- Reusable fixture patterns for consistent infrastructure testing
- Clear separation between infrastructure and business logic concerns

### Test Lifecycle Integration

**Fixture Scope Management**:
- **Session-Level**: Registry and configuration fixtures for test suite consistency
- **Test-Level**: Component fixtures for isolated test scenarios
- **Assertion-Level**: Data fixtures for granular validation points

Reference: `../strategy/test-organization.md` for detailed scope management patterns.

## Strategic Fixture Categories

### Infrastructure Component Fixtures

**Pipeline Infrastructure Testing**:
- Minimal concrete Pipeline implementations for infrastructure validation
- Configurable stage behavior supporting success/failure scenarios
- Context flow validation supporting data transition testing
- Registry integration supporting discovery and lookup validation

### Provider System Fixtures

**Registry Operation Testing**:
- Pre-populated registries for consistent provider testing
- Dynamic loading simulation for configuration injection validation
- Pipeline assignment patterns for authorization testing
- Error scenario coverage for configuration failure handling

### Configuration System Fixtures

**Configuration Pattern Testing**:
- Minimal valid configurations for infrastructure testing
- Complex multi-component scenarios for integration testing
- Invalid configuration patterns for validation testing
- Environment substitution patterns for variable replacement testing

Reference: `component-strategy.md` for fixture categorization by risk level.

## Fixture Organization Strategy

### Reusability Patterns

**Centralized Infrastructure Fixtures**:
- Base component fixtures used across multiple test scenarios
- Standard configuration patterns for common infrastructure scenarios
- Centralized creation patterns for consistent behavior across tests

**Test-Specific Customization**:
- Error scenario fixtures for edge case testing
- Performance fixtures for timing and monitoring validation
- Integration fixtures for complex multi-component workflow testing

### Maintenance Strategy

**Evolution Management**:
- Fixture alignment with abstract interface changes
- Versioning for test stability during infrastructure evolution
- Lifecycle management for obsolete test patterns

**Consistency Validation**:
- Fixture behavior alignment with real infrastructure components
- Test data patterns reflecting realistic infrastructure scenarios
- Error simulation aligned with actual infrastructure failure patterns

## Fixture Integration with Risk-Based Testing

Reference: `component-strategy.md` for component risk classification and `../strategy/risk-based-testing.md` for framework guidelines.

### High-Risk Component Support

**Comprehensive Validation Fixtures**:
- CLI integration workflow fixtures
- Provider registry lifecycle fixtures
- Context management data flow fixtures

### Performance and Maintenance

**Optimization Principles**:
- Lazy loading for efficient fixture creation
- Resource management for cleanup and isolation
- Minimal logic for reduced maintenance costs

This strategic fixture approach enables comprehensive infrastructure validation while maintaining clear boundaries between framework-stable patterns and implementation-dynamic content.
