# Infrastructure Mock Boundaries

Strategic framework for mock boundary decisions in infrastructure testing without business logic dependencies.

## Mock Boundary Decision Framework

### Component Classification for Mocking

**External Dependencies (MOCK)**:
- Service APIs and network requests
- File system operations beyond test environment
- System commands and environment variables
- Authentication and authorization systems

**Infrastructure Components (TEST DIRECTLY)**:
- Registry systems and dynamic loading
- Configuration processing and validation
- Context management and data flow
- Command routing and execution coordination

## Infrastructure System Boundaries

### Provider System Mock Strategy

**External Service Layer (MOCK)**:
- Third-party API calls and response handling
- Network authentication and token management
- External file access and permissions

**Provider Infrastructure (TEST DIRECTLY)**:
- Provider registry and dynamic loading mechanisms
- Configuration injection and validation logic
- Pipeline assignment and filtering authorization

### CLI System Mock Strategy

**External Execution Layer (MOCK)**:
- Subprocess calls and system commands
- Environment variable access for configuration
- External file system operations

**CLI Infrastructure (TEST DIRECTLY)**:
- Argument parsing and command dispatch
- Registry initialization and pipeline discovery
- Output formatting and error messaging
- Execution flow coordination

### Configuration System Mock Strategy

**External Environment (MOCK)**:
- Environment variable substitution sources
- External configuration file loading
- Network-based configuration sources

**Configuration Infrastructure (TEST DIRECTLY)**:
- JSON processing and validation logic
- Variable replacement and interpolation
- Provider setup and validation rules
- Error detection and messaging systems

## Infrastructure Risk Mitigation Strategy

Reference: `../strategy/risk-assessment.md` for component risk classification framework.

### High-Risk Component Mocking

**Mock External, Test Infrastructure**:
- CLI integration workflows
- Provider registry operations
- Context management systems

Apply comprehensive mock coverage for external dependencies while testing infrastructure logic directly.

### Mock Maintenance Principles

**Centralized Mock Evolution**:
- Interface alignment with infrastructure changes
- Consistent behavior across test scenarios
- Performance optimization for test execution

**Infrastructure Test Stability**:
- External service independence
- Deterministic mock responses
- Comprehensive failure scenario coverage

This strategic framework enables infrastructure validation while maintaining clear boundaries between controlled systems and external dependencies.
