# E2E Infrastructure Validation Patterns

Strategic patterns for end-to-end infrastructure validation implementing comprehensive component coordination testing without separate integration tests.

## Validation Strategy Overview

**Primary Approach**: Complete workflow validation covering multiple risk scenarios through realistic execution paths rather than isolated component integration testing.

**Risk Coverage Philosophy**: Single E2E tests address multiple component coordination risks through checkpoint validation at workflow transitions.

## Core E2E Validation Scenarios

### CLI Pipeline Discovery and Information Flow
**Risk Coverage**: Command routing, configuration loading, registry integration, provider setup
**Validation Pattern**: Complete CLI command execution with comprehensive output validation and error handling scenarios.

### Provider Registry Integration and Pipeline Assignment
**Risk Coverage**: Dynamic loading, configuration injection, pipeline filtering, file conflict detection
**Validation Pattern**: Provider lifecycle testing with complex multi-provider configurations and assignment validation.

### Context Execution Flow with Stage Management
**Risk Coverage**: Context data flow, stage coordination, provider access, error propagation
**Validation Pattern**: Complete execution workflows with context state validation at each transition point.

### Configuration System Integration
**Risk Coverage**: Environment resolution, provider configuration, error handling
**Validation Pattern**: Configuration lifecycle testing with environment variable processing and validation scenarios.

### Logging and Performance Integration
**Risk Coverage**: Context-aware logging, performance monitoring, output formatting
**Validation Pattern**: Logging system validation through complete workflow execution with output verification.

## Component Coordination Validation

### High-Risk Component Coverage
**CLI → Registry → Provider → Execution Flow**:
- Command parsing → Pipeline discovery → Provider setup → Context creation → Stage execution
- Comprehensive validation at each transition with realistic workflow patterns
- Error scenario coverage through workflow execution rather than isolated component testing

### Multi-Risk Test Consolidation
**Single Test, Multiple Risk Coverage**:
- Provider lifecycle tests cover configuration injection, authentication handling, data transformation, error handling
- CLI workflow tests cover command routing, provider loading, context flow, error handling
- Context execution tests cover data flow, dependency management, error propagation, state management

## Mock Boundary Strategy

### External Dependencies (MOCK)
- **Provider APIs**: External service calls with deterministic responses
- **File System Operations**: External file operations with controlled environments
- **Network Dependencies**: HTTP requests and authentication with mock responses

### Internal Systems (TEST DIRECTLY)
- **Pipeline Infrastructure**: Registry, context management, execution flow
- **Configuration System**: JSON loading, environment substitution, validation
- **Local Data Operations**: Context data flow, stage completion tracking

## Validation Checkpoint Pattern

### Workflow Transition Validation
**Registry Discovery**: Pipeline lookup and information retrieval validation
**Provider Setup**: Configuration injection and provider creation validation
**Context Creation**: Pipeline context initialization and provider injection validation
**Execution Flow**: Stage execution with context state and result validation
**Error Handling**: Graceful failure scenarios with appropriate error propagation

### State Validation Strategy
**Context Integrity**: Data consistency and state tracking throughout execution
**Component Coordination**: Proper handoff between CLI, registry, providers, and execution components
**Error Accumulation**: Proper error handling and reporting across component boundaries

## Implementation Reference

**Architectural Foundation**: E2E validation patterns align with `../strategy/test-consolidation.md` multi-risk coverage principles and `../strategy/mock-boundaries.md` external/internal testing boundaries.

**Risk Framework Application**: Component coordination validation implements `../strategy/risk-based-testing.md` three-tier risk assessment with comprehensive E2E coverage for high-risk infrastructure components.
