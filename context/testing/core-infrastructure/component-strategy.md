# Component Testing Strategy

Core infrastructure component classification using three-tier risk framework (reference: `../strategy/risk-based-testing.md` for complete guidelines).

## High-Risk Components (5-10% - Comprehensive Testing)

**CLI Pipeline Integration** (Comprehensive E2E Coverage):
- Command routing, registry discovery, execution flow validation
- Configuration loading → Provider setup → Context management → Command execution
- Error handling and recovery patterns across component boundaries

**Provider Registry System** (Comprehensive E2E Coverage):
- Dynamic loading, configuration injection, pipeline assignments
- Provider lifecycle management with external service mocking
- Registry coordination and discovery mechanisms

**Context Management** (Comprehensive E2E Coverage):
- Stage-to-stage data flow, state tracking, error accumulation
- Inter-component data passing and context integrity validation
- Pipeline execution state management and completion tracking

## Complex Components (10-15% - Good Unit Coverage)

**Configuration System**:
- Environment substitution and provider config validation
- JSON processing and validation logic
- Variable replacement and interpolation

**Logging Infrastructure**:
- Context-aware logging and performance monitoring
- Structured logging and display coordination

## Simple Components (75-85% - Smoke Tests)

**Abstract Base Classes**: Pipeline, Stage interfaces
**Utility Functions**: Error formatting, validation helpers
**Basic Infrastructure**: Registry systems, individual stage processing

## Core Infrastructure Testing Approach

**E2E Validation Strategy**: High-risk components validated through comprehensive E2E workflows rather than separate integration tests. This approach provides realistic component coordination validation while maintaining efficient test maintenance.

**Integration Testing Decision**: Integration tests were evaluated and determined unnecessary for core infrastructure. The E2E approach adequately covers component coordination scenarios that integration tests would address, with better workflow realism and lower maintenance overhead.

**Mock Boundary Strategy**: Reference `mock-boundaries.md` for infrastructure-specific external/internal testing boundaries.

**Validation Patterns**: Reference `e2e-validation-patterns.md` for comprehensive component coordination validation workflows.
