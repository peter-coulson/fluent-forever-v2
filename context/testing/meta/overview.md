# Testing Meta System Overview

## Purpose
Self-documenting framework for testing context maintenance, decision criteria, and boundary management.

## Meta System Components
- **Maintenance Models**: When and how testing context should be updated
- **Decision Frameworks**: Criteria templates for risk classification and test strategy selection
- **Boundary Definitions**: Clear inclusion/exclusion rules for testing context content
- **Update Triggers**: Change events that require testing context review

## Content Categories

### Framework-Stable Content
Derived from Risk-Based Testing principles - rarely changes:
- Risk assessment criteria templates
- Mock boundary decision frameworks

### Implementation-Dynamic Content
Populated during component development - evolves with system:
- Specific component risk classifications
- Actual test organization patterns
- Workflow-specific testing approaches

## Navigation
- **Maintenance Rules**: `maintenance-model.md` - update timing and responsibility
- **Decision Criteria**: `decision-framework.md` - risk classification templates
- **Content Boundaries**: `boundaries.md` - inclusion/exclusion rules for testing context

## Domain Boundaries

### System-Level Testing Context (This Context)
- **Risk-based testing framework** application to pipeline architecture
- **Strategic testing patterns** for pipeline systems generally
- **System component testing** (pipeline engine, stage system, provider registry)
- **Cross-cutting concerns** (configuration, logging, context management)

### Pipeline-Specific Testing Context (`context/modules/pipelines/`)
- **Individual pipeline testing** approaches (vocabulary, conjugation)
- **Pipeline implementation details** testing strategies
- **Pipeline-specific risk mappings** and workflow approaches

**Reference Flow**: Pipeline testing context references system testing framework (upward reference following context system principles).

## Implementation Planning Reference
**Temporary Guidance**: `../implementation-planning.md` contains abstract planning concepts for future implementation phase. This planning file will be deprecated once concrete implementation patterns emerge and actual testing directories are created.
