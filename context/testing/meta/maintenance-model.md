# Testing Context Maintenance Model

## Update Timing Strategy

### Framework-Stable Content (Rare Updates)
**When**: Risk-Based Testing principles change or major architectural shifts
**Content**: Risk assessment criteria, mock boundary frameworks
**Trigger**: Framework document updates, system architecture changes
**Responsibility**: Context system maintainer

### Implementation-Dynamic Content (Regular Updates)
**When**: During test refactor implementation, component development, post-refactor learnings
**Content**: Component risk mappings, test organization patterns, workflow-specific approaches
**Trigger**: Component changes, new risk scenarios discovered, test structure evolution
**Responsibility**: Developer implementing tests

## Update Procedures

### During Test Refactor
1. **Component Assessment**: Apply decision framework criteria to each component as encountered
2. **Pattern Documentation**: Record test organization patterns that emerge
3. **Risk Discovery**: Update risk mappings when new scenarios identified

### Post-Refactor Maintenance
1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Validate risk mappings against system evolution
2. **Change Triggers**: Update when components undergo architectural changes
3. **Pattern Updates**: Refine testing approaches based on maintenance experience

## Staleness Detection

**Framework Misalignment**: Testing context contradicts Risk-Based Testing principles
**Implementation Divergence**: Documented patterns don't match actual test structure
**Risk Classification Drift**: Components classified differently than testing approach suggests

## Testing Maintenance Approach

### Long-term Maintenance Strategy
- **Minimal test count** for long-term maintainability
- **Regular audit** to ensure tests remain aligned with risk assessment
- **Remove tests** that don't provide risk mitigation value
- **Maintain only** essential risk-mitigation tests for long-term maintenance

### Maintenance Decision Criteria
**Keep**: Tests that mitigate identified high-risk scenarios
**Remove**: Tests that provide development convenience but no risk mitigation
**Audit**: Regular review of test value vs maintenance cost

## Content Lifecycle

**Development Phase**: Comprehensive documentation during development
**Production Phase**: Minimal essential guidance aligned with risk-based principles
