# Testing Context Overview

## Purpose
Strategic testing guidance framework implementing Risk-Based Testing principles for pipeline-based language learning system.

## Domain Scope
- **Risk assessment frameworks** for system components
- **Strategic testing patterns** aligned with Risk-Based Testing principles
- **Test organization guidance** for system-level components

## Architecture Layers
- **Meta System** (`meta/`): Decision frameworks, maintenance models, and boundary definitions
- **Strategy Patterns** (`strategy/`): Risk-based testing application patterns
- **Core Infrastructure** (`core-infrastructure/`): Testing strategies for system components independent of pipeline implementations

## Navigation
- **Framework Foundations**: `meta/overview.md` → decision frameworks and maintenance models
- **Testing Strategy**: `strategy/overview.md` → risk-based patterns
- **Core Infrastructure**: `core-infrastructure/overview.md` → testing strategies for core system components
- **Test Structure**: `strategy/test-organization.md` → proposed test folder organization
