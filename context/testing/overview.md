# Testing Context Overview

## Purpose
Strategic testing guidance framework implementing Risk-Based Testing principles for pipeline-based language learning system.

## Domain Scope
- **Risk assessment frameworks** for system components
- **Strategic testing patterns** aligned with Risk-Based Testing principles
