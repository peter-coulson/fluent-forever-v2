# Risk-Based Testing Application

## Pipeline Architecture Risk Patterns

### Component Risk Assessment Framework
Apply TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md risk assessment criteria and `meta/decision-framework.md` evaluation templates to pipeline components:

**Pipeline Level**: Sequential stage execution with context flow
**Stage Level**: Individual processing units
**Provider Level**: External service integrations

Risk classification follows the **Impact + Detection Matrix** from decision framework, applied to pipeline-specific scenarios.

### Test Strategy Mapping

Applies TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md tool-to-risk mapping patterns to pipeline components:

**High-Risk Strategy**: Follow inverted pyramid from TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md
**Low-Risk Strategy**: Follow traditional pyramid from TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md

### Pipeline-Specific Risk Scenarios

**Vocabulary Pipeline**: Word → definition → audio → images → Anki cards
- **High-Risk**: Source data corruption, Anki synchronization failures
- **Medium-Risk**: Media generation, provider coordination

**Conjugation Pipeline**: Verb forms → audio → practice cards
- **High-Risk**: Form generation accuracy, database state management
- **Medium-Risk**: Audio generation, card template processing

## Application Pattern

Apply risk assessment **component-by-component** during test refactor, not system-wide pre-classification.
