# Test Consolidation Strategy

## "One Test, Multiple Risks" Design Patterns

### Pipeline Workflow Consolidation
**Single E2E Test Covering**:
- **Data Corruption Risk**: Source data validation and protection
- **Silent Failure Risk**: Pipeline execution with success/failure detection
- **Configuration Risk**: Provider setup and validation
- **Integration Risk**: Stage-to-stage data flow and error propagation

**Pattern**: Complete pipeline execution with comprehensive validation checkpoints

### Provider Integration Consolidation
**Single Integration Test Covering**:
- **Configuration Injection Risk**: Provider setup and validation
- **Authentication Risk**: API key handling and error scenarios
- **Data Transformation Risk**: Input/output processing validation
- **Error Handling Risk**: Graceful degradation and retry logic

**Pattern**: Provider lifecycle test with multiple failure scenario validation

### Stage Interaction Consolidation
**Single Integration Test Covering**:
- **Context Data Flow Risk**: Inter-stage data passing validation
- **Dependency Management Risk**: Stage ordering and prerequisite checking
- **Error Propagation Risk**: Failure handling across stage boundaries
- **State Management Risk**: Context integrity throughout execution

**Pattern**: Multi-stage execution with state validation at each transition

## Consolidation Decision Framework

### Prefer Consolidation When
- **Related Risk Scenarios**: Multiple risks within same execution path
- **Shared Setup Cost**: Common test environment or data preparation
- **Natural Workflow**: Risks occur in same user workflow sequence

### Avoid Consolidation When
- **Unrelated Failures**: Different root causes requiring different debugging
- **Setup Complexity**: Consolidated test becomes difficult to maintain
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Failure isolation becomes problematic

## Implementation Patterns

**Checkpoint Validation**: Multiple assertion points within single test execution
**Failure Scenario Branches**: Single test covering multiple error conditions through conditional paths
