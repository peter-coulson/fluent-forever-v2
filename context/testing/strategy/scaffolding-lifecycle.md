# Scaffolding Lifecycle Strategy

## Scaffolding Test Strategy
Bridge the gap between TDD development needs and minimal production testing through temporary comprehensive validation.

## Development Phase Scaffolding

### Comprehensive Validation Approach
**During Implementation** (TDD/development velocity):
- **Over-testing Acceptable**: Extensive E2E coverage for major pathways
- **Detailed Validation**: Transformation logic, error handling, edge cases
- **Quick Bug Identification**: Comprehensive test coverage supports LLM development
- **Development Confidence**: Tests help LLMs develop correct code patterns

### Pipeline Development Scaffolding
**Stage Development**: Comprehensive validation of each stage during implementation
- **Input/Output Validation**: Full data flow testing
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: All failure modes during development
- **Integration Testing**: Stage-to-stage handoff validation

**Workflow Development**: End-to-end pathway validation
- **Complete Pipeline Runs**: Full vocabulary/conjugation workflow testing
- **Provider Integration**: Real external service interaction testing
- **Configuration Validation**: All configuration permutations

## Production Transition Strategy

### Consolidation Criteria
**Successful Scaffolding → Minimal Production**:
- **Risk-Based Pruning**: Keep only high-risk scenario coverage
- **Aggressive Elimination**: Remove tests that don't mitigate identified risks
- **Consolidation**: Combine multiple scaffolding tests into single multi-risk tests

### Transition Decision Points
**Component Stability**: When implementation patterns are established
**Risk Validation**: When high-risk scenarios are clearly identified
**Maintenance Cost**: When test maintenance overhead exceeds risk mitigation value

## Lifecycle Management

**Key Insight**: Tests for LLM development velocity ≠ Tests for long-term maintenance
**Transition Timing**: After refactor completion when system patterns stabilize
**Retention Criteria**: Risk mitigation value vs maintenance cost analysis
