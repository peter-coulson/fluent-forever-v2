# Testing Strategy Overview

## Purpose
Strategic testing patterns for Risk-Based Testing applied to pipeline-based language learning system architecture.

## Strategy Pattern Categories

### Risk-Based Testing Application
Framework application patterns for component risk assessment and test strategy selection within pipeline architecture.

### Scaffolding Lifecycle Management
Development → production transition strategies implementing "scaffolding test" approach for pipeline system development.

### Mock Boundary Guidelines
Strategic patterns for determining external vs internal testing boundaries within provider-based architecture.

### Test Consolidation Patterns
"One test, multiple risks" design strategies optimized for pipeline workflow validation.

## Content Stability

These strategy patterns are **framework-stable** - derived from Risk-Based Testing principles and rarely change. They provide **application templates** rather than specific implementation guidance.

## Navigation
- **Risk-Based Framework**: `risk-based-testing.md` - applying RBT principles to pipeline components
- **Scaffolding Lifecycle**: `scaffolding-lifecycle.md` - development phase → production transition patterns
- **Mock Boundaries**: `mock-boundaries.md` - external/internal testing decision frameworks
- **Test Consolidation**: `test-consolidation.md` - multi-risk validation design patterns
- **Test Organization**: `test-organization.md` - architectural patterns for test directory structure and component organization

## Architecture Implementation

Strategy patterns are organized around system component risk assessment and testing approach selection:

**Core System Components**: Pipeline engine, stage system, provider registry risk evaluation
**Cross-cutting Concerns**: Configuration, logging, context management testing strategies
**Component Integration**: Cross-component dependency testing and workflow validation

## Application Context
Strategy patterns guide **decision-making during test refactor** rather than prescribing specific implementations. Apply risk assessment **component-by-component** during development, not system-wide pre-classification.
