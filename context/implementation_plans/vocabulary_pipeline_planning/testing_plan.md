Applied using Sequential Test Planning Framework to vocabulary pipeline implementation specification.

## Framework Application Summary

**Methodology Files Applied:**
- `sequential-execution-framework.md` - Core framework
- `scope-boundary-rules.md` - Boundary definitions
- `risk-assessment-process.md` - Risk classification
- `critical-test-patterns.md` - Test mapping
- `risk-based-testing.md` - Three-tier strategy

- `test-consolidation.md` - Multi-risk patterns

## Step 1: Boundary Validation

### External Boundary Components (Stages - Interface Testing Only)
Individual stages treated as external to implementation scope:

1. **Stage 1: Word Selection**
   - Interface: Input (count/filters/word list) → Output (word list)
   - Contract: Word existence validation, filtering logic, rank-based selection

2. **Stage 2: Word Processing**
   - Interface: Input (word list) → Output (populated word_queue.json)
   - Contract: Dictionary fetching, sense processing, queue population

3. **Stage 3: Media Generation**
   - Interface: Input (word queue with prompts) → Output (media files + status updates)
   - Contract: Prompt validation, media generation, status tracking

4. **Stage 4: Vocabulary Sync**
   - Interface: Input (word queue with media) → Output (vocabulary.json updates)
   - Contract: Review/approval processing, vocabulary updates, staging cleanup

5. **Stage 5: Anki Sync**
   - Interface: Input (vocabulary.json) → Output (Anki deck updates)
   - Contract: TBD (not yet defined)

### Internal Components (Full Testing Responsibility)
Pipeline integration and orchestration within implementation scope:

1. **Pipeline Orchestration Engine** - Sequential stage execution coordination
2. **Stage-to-Stage Data Flow** - Context management and data transformation
3. **Inter-Stage Error Propagation** - Error handling across stage boundaries
4. **Pipeline Configuration System** - Setup and validation of pipeline parameters
5. **Data Integrity Management** - Boundary validation and consistency checking
6. **Overall Workflow Coordination** - Resource management and stage dependencies

### Interface Contract Validation
✅ **Valid Boundaries Confirmed:**
- Clear input/output method signatures for each stage
- Expected data formats defined (JSON structures, file formats)
- Error handling patterns specified at stage interfaces
- Dependencies and integration points documented

## Step 2: Risk Assessment
