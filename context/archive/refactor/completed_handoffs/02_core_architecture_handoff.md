  - New pipelines module structure
  - Backward compatibility for validation gates

- **Breaking Changes**: None - all core architecture is additive

## Test Results

- **Previous Session Tests**: 1/1 passed (baseline system test continues to work)
- **New Test Coverage**: 70 unit tests covering all core components
- **Test Failures**: None - all tests passing

### Quality Metrics

- **Performance Impact**: All tests run in <1 second (well under requirements)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy and validation

## Implementation Insights

### Technical Decisions

1. **Decision**: Pipeline abstraction with abstract base classes
   - **Rationale**: Ensures consistent interface while allowing flexibility
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Duck typing, protocol-based interfaces
   - **Trade-offs**: Stronger contracts vs more flexibility

2. **Decision**: Context object for data flow between stages
   - **Rationale**: Centralized state management and dependency injection
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Global state, parameter passing
   - **Trade-offs**: Clear data flow vs potential complexity

3. **Decision**: Registry pattern for pipeline discovery
   - **Rationale**: Enables dynamic pipeline registration and discovery
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Static imports, configuration-based discovery
   - **Trade-offs**: Flexibility vs simplicity

4. **Decision**: StageResult with backward compatibility
   - **Rationale**: Clean interface that works with validation gate expectations
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Breaking validation gate, multiple result types
   - **Trade-offs**: Clean interface vs backward compatibility complexity

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Challenge**: Validation gate expectations vs clean design
   - **Root Cause**: Validation gate expected dict-like results and context
   - **Resolution**: Added __contains__ and __getitem__ to StageResult, context conversion
   - **Prevention**: Better interface design communication between sessions

2. **Challenge**: Balancing abstraction with concrete implementation
   - **Root Cause**: Need to provide working implementation for validation gates
   - **Resolution**: Created basic vocabulary pipeline with mock stages
   - **Prevention**: Define implementation depth requirements upfront

### Code Quality Notes
- **Design Patterns Used**: Abstract Factory (Pipeline), Strategy (Stage), Registry
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Stage implementations could be more DRY
- **Technical Debt**: Some hardcoded stage names and basic mock implementations
- **Performance Considerations**: Registry uses simple dict lookup, stages are lightweight

## Configuration and Setup

### New Configuration Files
- **Files**: No new configuration files required
  - **Purpose**: Core architecture uses existing logging and pytest configuration
  - **Key Settings**: All configuration inherited from existing system
  - **Dependencies**: Python 3.8+, existing project dependencies

### Environment Changes
- **Dependencies Added**: None (uses existing infrastructure)
- **System Requirements**: No changes to existing requirements
- **Setup Steps**: No additional setup - architecture is ready to use

## Integration Status

### Upstream Integration
Successfully integrates with Session 1 validation infrastructure:

- **Dependencies Met**: Uses validation gate testing framework from Session 1
- **Interfaces Used**: Existing pytest fixtures and logging configuration
- **Data Flow**: Compatible with existing project structure and patterns

### Downstream Preparation
Provides comprehensive foundation for all future sessions:

- **New Interfaces**: 
  - Pipeline abstract base class for all card types
  - Stage base class for pluggable processing
  - Registry system for pipeline discovery
  - Context system for data flow
  - CLI framework for consistent commands

- **Extension Points**: 
  - New pipelines can be added by extending Pipeline base class
  - New stages can be added by extending Stage base class
  - CLI can be extended with new commands via BaseCommand
  - Registry automatically discovers new pipeline types

- **Data Outputs**: 
  - Working pipeline execution with stage results
  - CLI commands for list/info/run operations
  - Registry system for pipeline management
  - Context system for stateful processing

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Limitation**: Basic stage implementations are mostly mock
   - **Impact**: Stages don't do real work yet, just demonstrate structure
   - **Workaround**: Validation gates pass with mock implementations
   - **Future Resolution**: Session 3 will implement real stage functionality

2. **Limitation**: No pipeline auto-registration system
   - **Impact**: Pipelines must be manually registered to be discovered
   - **Workaround**: Manual registration works for current needs
   - **Future Resolution**: Future sessions can add auto-discovery

### Future Improvements

1. **Improvement**: Add stage dependency validation
   - **Benefit**: Ensure stages execute in correct order
   - **Effort**: Medium (need to implement topological sort)
   - **Priority**: High for Session 3

2. **Improvement**: Add pipeline configuration system
   - **Benefit**: Allow pipelines to be configured without code changes
   - **Effort**: Medium (configuration loading and validation)
   - **Priority**: Medium for Session 6

## Next Session Preparation

### Required Context for Next Session
Session 3 (Stage System) needs:

- **Key Components**: 
  - Understanding of core architecture patterns
  - Pipeline and Stage base class interfaces
  - Context system for data flow
  - Registry pattern for discovery

- **Interface Contracts**: 
  - Pipeline.get_stage() and execute_stage() methods
  - Stage.execute() and validate_context() methods
  - Context data flow patterns
  - StageResult status and error handling

- **Configuration**: 
  - Core module provides base abstractions
  - Pipelines module provides concrete implementations
  - CLI module provides universal commands
  - Tests provide validation and examples

- **Test Setup**: 
  - All Session 2 validation gates pass
  - Unit tests demonstrate usage patterns
  - Integration with existing test infrastructure

### Recommended Approach
For Session 3 implementation:

- **Starting Points**: 
  - Build pluggable stage implementations in src/stages/
  - Create stage categories: claude_staging, media_generation, validation, sync
  - Focus on real implementations vs mock stages

- **Key Considerations**: 
  - Stages should be pipeline-agnostic where possible
  - Use provider pattern for external service integration
  - Maintain clean separation between stage logic and external dependencies

- **Potential Pitfalls**: 
  - Avoid tightly coupling stages to specific pipelines
  - Don't duplicate existing functionality - extract and reuse
  - Be careful with stage dependency chains becoming complex

- **Resources**: 
  - Core architecture provides solid foundation
  - Existing CLI commands show expected patterns
  - Unit tests demonstrate proper usage

### Validation Gates
E2E tests that Session 3 must pass:

- **Existing Functionality**: 
  - test_current_system.py must continue passing (no regressions)
  - test_session2_core.py must continue passing (core architecture)
  - All CLI commands must continue working

- **New Functionality**: 
  - test_session3_stages.py should pass (pluggable stage system)
  - Can create and register reusable stages
  - Can execute stages across different pipelines
  - Can handle stage dependencies correctly

- **Integration Points**: 
  - Stage system integrates with existing pipeline architecture
  - Reusable stages work with multiple pipeline types
