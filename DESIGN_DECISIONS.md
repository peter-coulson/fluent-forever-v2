# Fluent Forever V2 - Design Principles & Evolution

## üéØ Core Design Principles (Original Foundation)

### 1. **Memory-First Learning**
Personal visual associations create deep emotional memory anchors. The creative act of writing prompts is part of the learning process, not overhead to eliminate.

### 2. **Intelligent Automation** 
Automate only mechanical tasks (audio download, image generation, file management). Preserve human creativity in prompt writing and Claude's intelligence in meaning analysis.

### 3. **Radical Simplicity**
Every component must be understandable at a glance. Prefer 10 lines of clear code over 100 lines of clever code. Single script over complex architectures.

### 4. **Single Source of Truth**
One configuration file, one automation script, one word queue. No duplicate information across multiple documents.

### 5. **Fail Gracefully**
System continues working even if APIs are down. Never lose user work. Clear error messages and recovery paths.

### 6. **One Card Per Meaning**
Following Fluent Forever methodology: complex words get multiple cards with distinct images. Never conflate different meanings on one card.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (Original Vision)

### **Claude's Role - The Intelligence Layer**
- **Word Analysis**: Identify ALL distinct meanings/uses of Spanish words
- **Meaning Separation**: Create separate entries for each semantic usage
- **Context Provision**: Provide clear examples for each meaning
- **Batch Management**: Group meanings intelligently (‚â§5 cards per batch)
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure proper card creation and field population

### **System's Role - The Automation Layer**
- **Media Generation**: Create images from user prompts
- **Audio Acquisition**: Download native pronunciations
- **Card Creation**: Upload to Anki with proper formatting
- **Progress Tracking**: Update vocabulary database
- **File Management**: Organize media with semantic names

### **User's Role - The Creative Layer**
- **Prompt Creation**: Write image descriptions for each meaning
- **Quality Review**: Approve generated content
- **Learning**: Study the created cards

## üìà Evolution History & Decision Points

### Phase 8: Automation & Safety Refactor (August 2025)
Goal: Make the system faster to operate (card-first), safer (no accidental destructive ops), cheaper (dry-runs/caps), and easier to debug (strong validations + logs).

Key changes implemented:
- Claude staging + ingestion
  - Added a staging workflow so Claude fills a small JSON (per-meaning fields only), and the system ingests into `vocabulary.json` with derived fields (`CardID`, `ImageFile`, `WordAudio`) and full validation.
  - Commands: `prepare-claude-batch`, `ingest-claude-batch`.
  - Rationale: protects golden source, reduces tokens, enables dry-run + diffable ingestion.

- Media generation orchestrator
  - New idempotent planner with provenance file (`media/.index.json`), hard caps (`--max`), dry-runs, cost estimate, and a lockfile to prevent concurrent runs.
  - Commands: `media-generate`, `run-media-then-sync` (chains sync only on success).
  - Rationale: prevent duplicate/expensive API calls, guarantee post-run validation.

- Template export/validate/push
  - Export current templates/CSS; validate placeholders and HTML/CSS vs Anki; push updates when needed.
  - Removed `PersonalMnemonic` usage from templates/fields; validation now hard-fails on model/config field drift and instructs manual field removal in Anki when required.
  - Command: `validate-anki-templates`.
  - Rationale: ensures exact parity and safe, auditable template management.

- Anki sync improvements
  - Client unwrapping of AnkiConnect envelopes; added note find/update/delete; delete is guarded by TTY + exact human confirmation phrase (LLMs cannot auto-approve).
  - Detailed post-sync diffs (missing words/meanings and field-level differences) for fast diagnosis.
  - Command: `sync-anki-all`.
  - Rationale: reliable behavior, safe deletions, actionable debug logs.

- Pronunciation selection
  - Forvo selection moved to config-driven `priority_groups` with in-group ranking by positive votes (then total votes). Reuse one audio per word. Dropped unused ‚Äúpreferred accents‚Äù.
  - Rationale: predictable country grouping + quality-based choice.

- ‚ÄúNo duplication‚Äù system principle
  - Never duplicate: meanings, CardIDs, prompts, media filenames, audio per word.
  - Rationale: prevents ambiguity, reduces cost, keeps Anki/vocabulary in strict sync.

- Repo & commands structure
  - Moved scripts under `src/cli/`; added console entrypoints (`setup.cfg`). Root cleaned of Python scripts.
  - Commands referenced inline in docs; removed redundant cheat sheets.
  - Rationale: cleaner root, consistent invocation, simpler maintenance.

- Tests & validation
  - Added tests for template validator, Forvo prioritization, media generation (plan/dry-run), and Claude staging/ingestion.
  - Full suite passing; validations promoted to hard gates with high-signal logs.
  - Rationale: protect against regressions; ensure confidence in daily use.

Outcome: Faster card creation with strict safety rails, cheaper media operations, clearer recovery paths, and more maintainable code.

### **Phase 1: Original Foundation (August 2025)**
**Vision**: Local Stable Diffusion + Quentin Blake watercolor + Personal characters

**Core Workflow**:
```
word_queue.txt ‚Üí Claude analyzes meanings ‚Üí User provides prompts ‚Üí 
‚Üí Stable Diffusion generates ‚Üí Forvo downloads ‚Üí Anki cards created
```

**Key Files**: `automation.py`, `CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`

### **Phase 2: Technical Reality Check (Testing Phase)**
**Problem**: Local models too slow, character consistency impossible

**Testing Results**:
- **Personal Characters**: ‚ùå Complete inconsistency across images
- **Quentin Blake Style**: ‚ùå Too variable and interpretive  
- **Local Generation**: ‚ùå Minutes per image vs seconds
- **Setup Complexity**: ‚ùå High barrier to entry

**Decision**: Pivot to API-based generation with defined artistic style

### **Phase 3: API Integration & Style Refinement (Experimental Phase)**
**Solution**: OpenAI DALL-E 3 + Studio Ghibli aesthetic

**Style Evolution**:
1. **Studio Ghibli Style**: Consistent anime aesthetic for memorable visual learning
2. **Multiple Style Testing**: Pixar, Comic Book, Reference Sheets, etc.
3. **Studio Ghibli**: Final choice for consistency

**Key Finding**: **Style consistency is fundamental for learning**
- Well-defined styles (Ghibli) perform better than interpretive ones
- Emotional engagement aids memory formation
- Consistent aesthetic across cards aids pattern recognition

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Higher per-image cost ($0.04 vs ~$0.001 local)
- Internet dependency
- No custom character training

### **Phase 4: System Restoration & Integration (August 2025)**
**Goal**: Return to original principles while keeping proven improvements

**Restored Components**:
- **Word Queue Processing**: Systematic vocabulary coverage
- **Claude Intelligence Layer**: Meaning analysis and batch management

- **Progress persistence**: Never lose work, always continue from last state

**Result**: Seamless daily practice workflow - 2-3 minutes per 5-card batch

### **Phase 6: Pronunciation Strategy Optimization (August 2025)**
**Problem**: Generic pronunciation didn't optimize for global comprehension
**Goal**: Sound native-like in multiple regions while maximally understood

**Research Insight**: **Contextual fricatives** create optimal Spanish accent
- **Word-initial consonants**: Clear stops [b,d,g] for clarity
- **Intervocalic consonants**: Natural fricatives [Œ≤,√∞,…£] for fluency
- **Regional perception**: Educated Colombian/Mexican/Venezuelan accent
- **Global understanding**: No problematic regional markers

**Technical Implementation**:
- Latin American Spanish IPA with contextual fricative rules
- Forvo pronunciation selection via `priority_groups` + vote ranking
- Automatic phonetic conversion for unknown words

**Pronunciation Impact**: Sounds sophisticated and educated across all Spanish-speaking regions

### **Phase 7: LLM-Powered Contextual Learning (August 2025)**
**Problem**: Static sentence templates didn't match user's visual prompts
**Goal**: Perfect alignment between image scenes and language examples

**Innovation**: **Dynamic sentence generation**
- User provides visual scene description
- LLM analyzes: word + meaning + visual context  
- Generates perfect Spanish sentence matching scene
- Creates ideal image-language memory connections

**Example**:
- **User prompt**: "boy with hammer driving nails in basement"
- **System generates**: "El ni√±o trabaja con un martillo en el s√≥tano"
- **Perfect alignment**: Visual scene matches language example exactly

**Learning Enhancement**: Exponentially stronger memory formation through contextual coherence
