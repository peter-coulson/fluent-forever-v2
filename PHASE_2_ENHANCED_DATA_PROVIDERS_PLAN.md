# Phase 2: Enhanced Data Provider System

## Overview
Build upon the pipeline assignment foundation to implement advanced data provider features including read-only permissions, multiple named providers, and file-specific access controls.

## Prerequisites
**DEPENDS ON**: Phase 1 (Universal Pipeline Assignment System) must be completed first. This phase assumes pipeline-based provider filtering is already functional at the registry level.

## Scope
This phase focuses specifically on **data providers only**, enhancing them with permissions and multiple named instances while leveraging the pipeline assignment system from Phase 1.

## Core Enhancement Areas

### 1. Data Provider Permission System
- **Read-Only Enforcement**: Data providers can be configured with read-only flag
- **Write Protection**: Attempting to save to read-only providers raises clear error messages
- **Source Data Protection**: Prevent accidental corruption of input dictionaries and reference files
- **Permission Validation**: Config validates permission settings during provider creation

### 2. Multiple Named Data Providers
- **Named Instance Support**: Registry supports multiple named data providers simultaneously
- **Specific File Assignments**: Each named provider manages defined set of files
- **Clear Ownership**: Each file belongs to exactly one provider, eliminating conflicts
- **File-Level Access Control**: Different files can have different access patterns

### 3. Enhanced JSON Provider Implementation
- **Permission-Aware Operations**: JSONDataProvider enforces read-only restrictions
- **File Ownership Tracking**: Providers know which specific files they manage
- **Conflict Prevention**: Validation ensures no file conflicts between named providers
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing "default" provider pattern continues working

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Data Provider Base Class Enhancement
- **Permission Interface**: Add read-only property and enforcement to base `DataProvider`
- **File Assignment Tracking**: Base class supports file ownership specification
- **Validation Methods**: Standard validation for permission and file conflicts

### 2. JSON Provider Enhancements
- **Permission Enforcement**: Modify `_save_data_impl` to check read-only flag
- **File Filtering**: Support for file-specific access controls
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when write operations attempted on read-only providers

### 3. Registry Data Provider Management
- **Multiple Named Registration**: Support registering multiple data providers with different names
- **File Conflict Validation**: Ensure no overlapping file assignments between providers
- **Permission Tracking**: Registry maintains permission metadata for each named provider

### 4. Configuration Schema for Data Providers
- **Named Provider Structure**: Support multiple named data provider configurations
- **Permission Specification**: Read-only flags in provider configuration
- **File Assignment Arrays**: Explicit file ownership specification per provider
- **Migration Support**: Automatic handling of legacy single-provider configs

## Benefits
- **Data Protection**: Read-only providers prevent source data corruption
- **Multi-File Workflows**: Support complex pipelines with different file access patterns
- **Clear Ownership**: Explicit file-to-provider assignments eliminate confusion
- **Flexible Permissions**: Different files can have different access controls
- **Pipeline Integration**: Leverages Phase 1 pipeline assignment for complete access control

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Multiple named data providers can be configured and registered
- ✅ Read-only data providers reject write operations with clear error messages
- ✅ File assignments prevent conflicts between named providers
- ✅ Pipeline assignment (from Phase 1) works with multiple named data providers
- ✅ Existing single data provider configs continue working unchanged

## Dependencies
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Universal Pipeline Assignment System must be fully implemented
- **Registry Infrastructure**: Phase 1's provider filtering must be operational
- **Configuration Schema**: Phase 1's pipeline assignment config support required

## Deliverables
- Enhanced `JSONDataProvider` with permission enforcement
- Updated `DataProvider` base class with permission interface
- Registry support for multiple named data providers
- Configuration schema for named data providers with permissions
- Validation logic for file conflicts and permission consistency
- Migration support for legacy configurations
- Updated documentation for multiple named data provider usage

## Example Configuration
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "data": {
      "vocab_sources": {
        "type": "json",
        "files": ["spanish_dictionary"],
        "read_only": true,
        "pipelines": ["vocabulary"]
      },
      "work_files": {
        "type": "json",
        "files": ["word_queue", "debug_output", "vocabulary"],
        "read_only": false,
        "pipelines": ["vocabulary"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
