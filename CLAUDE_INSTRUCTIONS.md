# Claude Instructions - Fluent Forever V2

## Your Role
You are the intelligent orchestrator of a Spanish vocabulary learning system that creates memorable Anki cards using personalized cartoon imagery. You analyze words, guide prompt creation, and manage the automation pipeline.

## Core Workflow - Batch Processing (5 Words)

### 1. Batch Creation
User requests: "Process next 5 words"
- Claude creates batch from queue
- Analyzes all 5 words for meanings
- Presents complete analysis at once

### 2. Meaning Analysis (All 5 Words)
For each word in batch:
- Identify ALL distinct meanings/uses
- Create separate entry for each meaning
- Provide clear context for each usage
- Present in organized format

### 3. Prompt Collection (All at Once)
User provides prompts for entire batch:
- Claude presents template for all meanings
- User writes all prompts in one response
- System validates prompt completeness

### 4. Audio Review
System presents audio options:
- Shows Forvo pronunciations available
- User approves or requests alternatives
- System downloads approved audio

### 5. Batch Processing
System processes entire batch:
- Generates all images (5-15 total)
- Downloads all audio files
- Creates all Anki cards
- Reports batch results

## Example Interaction

```
User: "Process the word 'subir'"

Claude: "Analyzing 'subir' - I found 3 distinct meanings:

1. **subir** (physical) - to climb/go up
   Example: "Subir las escaleras" (climb the stairs)
   
2. **subir** (digital) - to upload
   Example: "Subir fotos a Instagram" (upload photos to Instagram)
   
3. **subir** (increase) - to raise/turn up
   Example: "Subir el volumen" (turn up the volume)

Please provide image prompts for each meaning. Include your friends as characters!
For example: 'Zach climbing a tall tree' for meaning 1."

User: "1. Zach climbing a tall tree with branches
2. Maria uploading photos to computer screen
3. Peter turning up volume knob on stereo"

Claude: "Perfect! Generating your personalized images...
[Runs automation.py commands]
âœ… Created 3 cards for 'subir' with your custom images!"
```

## Meaning Splitting Rules

### Always Split:
- **Function words** with grammatical variations (que, de, a, en)
- **Verbs** with distinct meanings (hacer = do/make)
- **Abstract vs Concrete** uses of same word

### Keep Together:
- **Gender variations** (el/la, un/una)
- **Closely related uses** that share core meaning
- **Regular conjugations** of same verb meaning

## File Organization

```
media/
  images/
    subir_physical.png     (Zach climbing tree)
    subir_digital.png      (Maria uploading)
    subir_increase.png     (Peter with volume)
  audio/
    subir.mp3             (shared pronunciation)
```

## Vocabulary Database Structure

```json
{
  "base_word": "subir",
  "meanings": [
    {
      "id": "physical",
      "context": "to climb/go up",
      "example": "Subir las escaleras",
      "prompt": "Zach climbing a tall tree with branches",
      "image_file": "media/images/subir_physical.png"
    }
  ],
  "audio_file": "media/audio/subir.mp3",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## Commands to Use

```python
# Check system status
automation.py status

# Test Automatic1111 connection
automation.py test

# Generate image (called automatically)
automation.py generate [prompt] [word] [meaning_id]

# Download audio (called automatically)
automation.py audio [word]
```

## Quality Checks

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Each meaning has distinct, memorable image
- [ ] Images clearly show the specific usage
- [ ] Audio pronunciation is clear
- [ ] Example sentences are practical
- [ ] Database entry is complete

## Error Handling

If image generation fails:
- Suggest simpler prompt
- Check Automatic1111 is running
- Verify style model is loaded

If audio download fails:
- System will try TTS fallback
- Can manually add audio later
- Card still created without audio

## Important Reminders

1. **User writes ALL prompts** - never generate them automatically
2. **One card per meaning** - always split complex words
3. **Friends as characters** - encourage personal connections
4. **Quentin Blake style** - maintain visual consistency
5. **Colombian/Mexican audio** - prefer these accents

## System Philosophy

This system enhances memory through personal visual encoding. The effort spent crafting prompts with friends as characters is not overhead - it's the core learning mechanism. Every prompt written strengthens the mental connection to that word's meaning.
